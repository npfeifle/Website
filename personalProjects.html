    <h3>These are some of my personal projects. Please feel free to try them out!</h3> 
    <h5><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Many of these projects are games and puzzles. I am not the owner or creater of any of these games, I have simply done my best to recreate them. The purpose of this site is to showcase my coding and problemsolving skills, not to claim ownership. If you enjoy any of these games, please visit their official websites! I will do my best to link as much as possible.</h3>
