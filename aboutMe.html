    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Nicholas Michael Pfeifle.  
      I recently graduated from George Mason University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
      I made this website as a way to showcase my skills and practice coding.
      Please feel free to take a look at some of the personal projects I have put together in my spare time.
      If you like what you see on this site, please feel free to email me at: npfeifle@masonlive.gmu.edu or nmpfeifle@gmail.com.
